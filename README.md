# This is my First JavaScript base project

<h2>Calculator</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS and JS were used to create this projetc. However, main functionality was added by JavaScript</p>

<p> This is mainly created to get feedback from seniors about how they feel looking at the code, whether it is acceptable code for programmers or not</p>


<p> Thank you for taking time looking into this </p>
